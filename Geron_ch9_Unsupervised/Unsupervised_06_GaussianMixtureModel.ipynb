    "\n",
    "Assume generative model that says this data came from a mixture of Gaussian distributions. Number of Gaussians is a parameter for the simpler implementation. The algorithm finds the mean and variance of each, plus a weight. Sensitive to local minima. Tends to find ellipsoid clusters no matter what.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use expectation maximization (EM). E step: assign instances to clusters (ditributions) and compute the probability of the data given the model. M step: update the model (how?). Uses soft clustering i.e. each instance assigned to each cluster with some probability, and the update uses all the probabilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "The model makes a big distinction of how the covariances are related.\n",
    "* spherical - all clusters are spherical\n",
    "* diag - covariance matrices are diagonal matrices\n",
    "* tied - boundaries are roughly parallel\n",
    "* full - any of the above"

    "## Applications:\n",
    "* Anomaly/outlier detection during training - set a minimum density parameter. The algorithm is sensitive to outliers so remove them till the model settles down.\n",
    "* Novelty detection during testing - train on clean data, test for improbable data(not explained)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other algorithms for anomaly detection\n",
    "* PCA - do the inverse transform and compare reconstruction error.\n",
    "* Fast-MCD - minimum covariance determinant.\n",
    "* Isolation Forest - build very RF randomly then prune isolated instances. This one scales well.\n",
    "* Local Outlier Factor - examine neighbor density per instance.\n",
    "* One-class SVM - Use higher dimensional space. Does not scale.\n"
