There is a d-dimensional vector w that maximizes Fisher's Score. Of all hyperplanes perpendicular to w, one maximally separates the classes. Use least squares regression to find its intercept: wx+b=0. Now w is linear combination of features but also a latent feature that maximally separates classes.
